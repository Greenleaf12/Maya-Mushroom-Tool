# Maya-Mushroom-Tool
Creates random procedural mushrooms

Has fully working UI with many options to adjust the mushrooms shape and size. It can also spawn many of them on a simple terrain to see what a bunch of them would look like. 

It adds basic materials to appropiate areas which can then be easily replaced with better ones in Unreal, Blender, etc. Automatic UV options too.
